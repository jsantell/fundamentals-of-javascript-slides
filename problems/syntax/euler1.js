/*
 * Find all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
 *
 * Some things you could use:
 *
 * `for` loops for counting to 1000
 * `%` modulo for determining if a number is a multiple of 3 or 5
 * `if` statements to do something once a multiple is found
 * `=` assignments to store results and progress
 *
 * Use `console.log(result)` to print the variable `result` to the console
